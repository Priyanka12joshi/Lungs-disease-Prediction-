# Lung Disease Prediction & Analysis
A comprehensive data-driven pipeline to explore, cluster, and predict lung disease cases using real-world patient data. This project:

# âž¤ Key Components
## Unsupervised Learning â€“ Clustering & Silhouette Analysis

Explored natural groupings in patient features using algorithms like kâ€‘means, hierarchical clustering, etc.

Determined optimal number of clusters using Silhouette score, which measures cluster cohesion vs. separationâ€”higher scores indicate better-defined clusters

.

Visualized clusters with tâ€‘SNE or PCA for intuitive understanding of subgroups.

## Supervised Learning â€“ Regression & Classification

Regression models (e.g. linear/logistic, random forest regressor) were built to predict continuous lung health indicators (e.g. lung capacity).

Classification models (e.g. logistic regression, SVM, random forest classifier) were trained to predict disease presence or severity.

Each model was evaluated individuallyâ€”metrics include RMSE/RÂ² for regression and accuracy/precision/recall/F1-score/AUC for classification.

Comparison & Visualization

Analyzed the performance of clustering, regression, and classification pipelines side-by-side.

Visualized evaluation metrics with charts (bar plots, ROC curves) and plotted predicted vs. actual values for regression.

Highlighted how clustering insights could improve supervised model performance by segmenting patient subgroups.

## ðŸŽ¯ Highlights for Portfolio
Combined unsupervised and supervised learning to uncover hidden patterns and predict lung disease outcomes.

Demonstrated robust cluster validation via Silhouette analysis, balancing cohesion and separation
